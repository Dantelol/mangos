DB Developers and End-Users:

Please place any custom data SQL files in this folder.

I Suggest you use some type of numbering system like the current official SQL files to prevent conflicts.

When you use option #1 in the Windows_Install_Script.BAT it will also look for any custom data here and include it when it updates the Server.

Please Note: The Stable Option #2 Does NOT Include Custom Data.

Thank You!

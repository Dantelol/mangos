-- Improved Stitches script used at end of quest 252 (Translation to Ello) to make it closer
-- to what it was on retail:
-- Stitches is now neutral at spawn and will no longer kill Abercombrie
-- Stitches turns hostile when reaching the road
-- Stitches now attacks the Night Watch guards on its way to Darkshire
-- Town Crier (creature 468) now has several yells to inform players of Stitches progress toward Darkshire
-- Prevented Stitches to spawn twice
